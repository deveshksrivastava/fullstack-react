To prepare for common exceptions in an e-commerce app, here’s a list of typical errors that may occur and the corresponding exceptions you should handle in your application:

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization Errors**
   - **User Not Found** (`USER_NOT_FOUND`): When a user tries to log in or perform an action but their account doesn't exist.
   - **User Already Exists** (`USER_ALREADY_EXISTS`): When a new user tries to sign up, but the email or username is already in use.
   - **Incorrect Password** (`INCORRECT_PASSWORD`): When a user enters the wrong password during login.
   - **Unauthorized Access** (`UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS`): When a user attempts to access a restricted area without proper authentication.
   - **Forbidden** (`FORBIDDEN_ACCESS`): When a user does not have permission to perform a specific action.
   - **Token Expired** (`TOKEN_EXPIRED`): When a user's authentication token is no longer valid.

### 2. **Validation Errors**
   - **Unprocessable Entity** (`UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY`): When the data provided by the user is invalid (e.g., form validation failed, wrong data type, missing required fields).
   - **Invalid Request Parameters** (`INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMS`): When the request contains invalid query parameters or path parameters.

### 3. **Resource Errors**
   - **Product Not Found** (`PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND`): When the requested product is not available or doesn’t exist in the database.
   - **Category Not Found** (`CATEGORY_NOT_FOUND`): When the requested category doesn't exist in the system.
   - **Order Not Found** (`ORDER_NOT_FOUND`): When a user tries to view or modify an order that doesn't exist.

### 4. **Order & Payment Errors**
   - **Payment Failed** (`PAYMENT_FAILED`): When the payment provider returns an error (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid card).
   - **Invalid Payment Method** (`INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD`): When a user tries to use an unsupported or incorrect payment method.
   - **Cart Is Empty** (`CART_IS_EMPTY`): When a user attempts to place an order without items in their cart.
   - **Insufficient Stock** (`INSUFFICIENT_STOCK`): When a user tries to purchase more items than are available in stock.

### 5. **Server & System Errors**
   - **Internal Server Error** (`INTERNAL_EXCEPTION`): A generic error for unexpected issues on the server side.
   - **Service Unavailable** (`SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`): When a third-party service (e.g., payment gateway) is temporarily down.
   - **Database Connection Error** (`DB_CONNECTION_ERROR`): When the application is unable to connect to the database.

### 6. **Shipping & Fulfillment Errors**
   - **Invalid Shipping Address** (`INVALID_SHIPPING_ADDRESS`): When the shipping address provided by the user is invalid.
   - **Order Already Shipped** (`ORDER_ALREADY_SHIPPED`): When a user tries to modify or cancel an order that has already been shipped.

### 7. **Rate Limiting & Throttling Errors**
   - **Too Many Requests** (`TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`): When the user exceeds the number of allowed requests (rate limiting).
   - **API Limit Exceeded** (`API_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`): When a user or system exceeds the limit for API calls within a specific period.

### 8. **Other Errors**
   - **Coupon Invalid** (`COUPON_INVALID`): When the user tries to apply an invalid or expired coupon.
   - **Discount Expired** (`DISCOUNT_EXPIRED`): When a discount or promo code has already expired.

### Updated `ErrorCodes` Enum:

```typescript
export enum ErrorCodes {
    // Authentication & Authorization Errors
    USER_NOT_FOUND = 1001,
    USER_ALREADY_EXISTS = 1002,
    INCORRECT_PASSWORD = 1003,
    UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS = 1004,
    FORBIDDEN_ACCESS = 1005,
    TOKEN_EXPIRED = 1006,

    // Validation Errors
    UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY = 2001,
    INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMS = 2002,

    // Resource Errors
    PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND = 3001,
    CATEGORY_NOT_FOUND = 3002,
    ORDER_NOT_FOUND = 3003,

    // Order & Payment Errors
    PAYMENT_FAILED = 4001,
    INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD = 4002,
    CART_IS_EMPTY = 4003,
    INSUFFICIENT_STOCK = 4004,

    // Server & System Errors
    INTERNAL_EXCEPTION = 5001,
    SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE = 5002,
    DB_CONNECTION_ERROR = 5003,

    // Shipping & Fulfillment Errors
    INVALID_SHIPPING_ADDRESS = 6001,
    ORDER_ALREADY_SHIPPED = 6002,

    // Rate Limiting & Throttling Errors
    TOO_MANY_REQUESTS = 7001,
    API_LIMIT_EXCEEDED = 7002,

    // Other Errors
    COUPON_INVALID = 8001,
    DISCOUNT_EXPIRED = 8002
}
```

### Example `HttpException` Usage:

```typescript
export class HttpException extends Error {
    message: string;
    statusCode: number;
    errorCode: ErrorCodes;
    errorMessage: any;

    constructor(message: string, statusCode: number, errorCode: ErrorCodes, errorMessage: any = null) {
        super(message);
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.errorCode = errorCode;
        this.errorMessage = errorMessage;
    }
}
```

### What You Should Consider:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Handle errors like invalid tokens, expired tokens, and unauthorized access.
- **Validation**: Ensure that bad data is caught and returned with clear error messages.
- **Resource Management**: Handle missing resources such as products, categories, and orders.
- **Order & Payment**: Handle failed payments, invalid methods, and other checkout-related errors.
- **System Errors**: Prepare for server errors, third-party service failures, and rate-limiting issues.
  
This list should give you a strong foundation to handle common e-commerce exceptions.
